Template for interactive graphics in [Researches](https://yandex.ru/company/researches/).

`index.html` contains several standard elements for separate infographics (which we embed in iframe): headers, buttons, infopanes, etc. I recommend using it as a template for such projects. All necessary stylesheets and scripts are already linked there.

`free-research.html` is the same for free research projects, e.g. [Cities](https://yandex.ru/company/researches/2017/cities). It contains elements like slides, cuts, etc. and is linked with `free-research.css`.
